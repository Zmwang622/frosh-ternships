These aren't the only companies that only hire freshmen and sophomores. Your best bet is to apply to [as many places as possible](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships), apply to companies **local to Pittsburgh and your hometown**, and reach out to any connections you have. It's hard, but not impossible!
