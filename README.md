## ðŸŒŸ CMU ðŸŒŸ
CMU is worse than Pitt but they do have some cool jobs. Many haven't opened, but that means you have more time to form relationships with professors and get recommendations!  

[Here's a great document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xI-krdfT2QbaXbNno4jjaptXRjmXcHBX/view) provided by [Katie Morrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katelyncmorrison98/) detailing each CMU internship and their relevant info!
| Department | Status |
| --------- | -------------|
| [Language Tech Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/news/language-technologies-institute-summer-internships-2021)| Closed! |
| [Robotics Institute for Summer Scholars](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/apply/)| Open!|
| [Software Engineering Research](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/isr/reuse/) | Fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfg9giSilpyii-mw2niw3bjDov5SzGeE5VTjVJuAik8Vkxg3g/viewform) to be notified of when it opens. |
|[Human Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/news/2020/hcii-seeks-researchers-summer-2021-program) | Open! | 
|[ECE](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/bs-in-ece/summer-internship.html)| Opening Mid January |


These aren't the only companies that only hire freshmen and sophomores. Your best bet is to apply to [as many places as possible](https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/Summer2021-Internships), apply to companies **local to Pittsburgh and your hometown**, and reach out to any connections you have. It's hard, but not impossible!
